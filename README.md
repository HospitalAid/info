# COVID-19 VentCentral Project

This project is part of [#projectopenair](https://www.projectopenair.org/), a collection of "Helpful Engineers" who have congregated to help in the COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic.

This project is currently in the Definition stage.

[See proposal document](https://github.com/Helpful-Engineers/resources/blob/master/software/proposals/ventilator_knowledge_database.md).

We need volunteers! Let's rock it!

## Project Description

Web and mobile app to help bridge the gap between volunteers and hospital equipment repair needs. The platform will track the status of ventilators in public hospitals and provide volunteers access to technical resources.

A mechanical ventilation support may be needed in the treatment of the more severe respiratory distress cases of the COVID-19 disease. One major concern is the shortage of proper patient care equipment in the worst-case scenario of the COVID-19 outbreak, especially in the countries with low Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index. Therefore, it is important to track the availability of this kind of equipment in a given geographic region, including their operational conditions. If repair is needed, volunteers will need access to verified technical resources such as repair guides provided/reviewed by Biomedical Technicians to perform the proper intervention and safe deployment.

An important source of technical information will be available through iFixIt API as they are crowdsourcing medical equipment repair information.

Main functionalities:
* Map-based ventilator tracking dashboard
* Call for assistance (volunteers and/or parts)
* Resources
  * Manuals and Repair Guides (provided by iFixit.com API and other sources)
  * Biomedical Technician contact info (volunteers may access them when needed)
