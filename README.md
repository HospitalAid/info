# VentCentral Project

Project VentCentral goal is to bridge the gap between volunteers and hospital equipment repair needs. The web and mobile platform will track the status of ventilators in public hospitals and provide volunteers access to technical resources.

This project is currently in the Definition stage.

We need volunteers! Let's rock it!

## Project Description

Project VentCentral goal is to bridge the gap between volunteers and hospital equipment repair needs. The web and mobile platform will track the status of ventilators in public hospitals and provide volunteers access to technical resources.

This project is part of [Helpful Engineering](https://www.helpfulengineering.org), a 3.400+ strong volunteer organization, with engineers, scientists and doctors around the world dedicated to helping the world address the COVID-19 pandemic. Relying on the resourcefulness and grit of our members, we work to design innovative ways to fight the virus that causes this disease.

A mechanical ventilation support may be needed in the treatment of the more severe respiratory distress cases of the COVID-19 disease. One major concern is the shortage of proper patient care equipment in the worst-case scenario of the COVID-19 outbreak, especially in the countries with low Universal Health Coverage (UHC) index. Therefore, it is important to track the availability of this kind of equipment in a given geographic region, including their operational conditions. If repair is needed, volunteers will need access to verified technical resources such as repair guides provided/reviewed by Biomedical Technicians to perform the proper intervention and safe deployment.

An important source of technical information will be available through iFixIt API as they are crowd-sourcing medical equipment repair information.

VentCentral platform main functionalities:
* Map-based ventilator tracking dashboard
* Call for assistance (volunteers and/or parts)
* Resources
  * Manuals and Repair Guides (provided by iFixit.com API and other sources)
  * Biomedical Technician contact info (volunteers may access them when needed)
